# Naming Convention

## Camel Case <br>
Layer names should be organized and in camel case to keep file structures readible for maintainers <br>
**Example:** `camelCase`

## File Names <br>
File naming convention is ordered as `projectName` + `underscore` + `startingFrame` + `underscore` + `endingFrame`
<br>
**Example:** `projectName_0_25`
**Multifile Example:** `charWalk1_0_60` `charWalk2_61_120`

<br>
**Note:** Files should be no more than 60 frames long
